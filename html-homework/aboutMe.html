				<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>
					I have been studying anatomy and physiology the past few years in an effort to become a Registered Nurse, but have just recently decided to pursue software engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have always had a passion for technology growing up and believed that we as a society should always pursue advancements in tech. I think we should tread carefully in the world of artificial intelligence but we need to continually grow our knowledge otherwise.
